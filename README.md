# Ganymede Take-Home Exercise

Thank you for taking an interest in Ganymede!  As part of our interview process, we want to offer you the opportunity to demonstrate your skills and thought process, outside the context of an in-person discussion.

Feel free to spend as much time as you'd like on the component you've been assigned, though we would recommend spending no more than 2-4 hours on this and letting us know the amount of time you've spent.
